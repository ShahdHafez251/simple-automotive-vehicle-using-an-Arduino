# simple-automotive-vehicle-using-an-Arduino
In this project, we design a very simple automotive vehicle that runs using an Arduino microcontroller, driver motors and ultrasonic sensor.We have 5 functions in our code readping, readpingrotated, movestop, moveForward and rotation.
Readping Here we measure the distance between the automotive vehicle and anything in front of it and return it to decide if the vehicle moves forward or turn to right. Readpingrotated in this function we make the automotive vehicle to turn right and sense the distance and return it to the sensor. Movestop We here make the vehicle stop moving by setting all motor enables to low. moveForward We make the vehicle move forward by setting all enables to high. Rotation This function we use it to turn the vehicle to right then move the vehicle forward.
